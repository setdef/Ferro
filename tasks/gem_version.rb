# A gem's version, and the version a bump moves it to.
#
# Ferro writes versions as SemVer: <tt>0.1.0</tt>, or a prerelease such as
# <tt>1.0.0-beta.1</tt>, in version.rb, in tags, and in CHANGELOG headings
# (plan 011, Versioning). RubyGems stores that version as
# <tt>1.0.0.pre.beta.1</tt>, which is how Gemfile.lock and the built
# package's file name spell it. Versions released before that rule, such
# as <tt>0.1.0.pre.4</tt>, were written in RubyGems' form, and still are
# wherever they are tagged. This class reads either form, remembers which
# one it was given, and writes it back unchanged with #to_s; #rubygems and
# #cargo write the other two spellings. Ordering is RubyGems', which is
# what users' Bundler applies: it reads the hyphen of <tt>0.1.0-pre.5</tt>
# as <tt>.pre.</tt>, giving <tt>0.1.0.pre.pre.5</tt>, which sorts before
# <tt>0.1.0.pre.4</tt>, because a text segment sorts before a number.
#
# A bump always writes the SemVer form. The bump rules are ported from
# ratatui_ruby-devtools 0.4.1
# (<tt>lib/ratatui_ruby/devtools/tasks/bump/sem_ver.rb</tt>, by the same
# author under the same license).
#
# === Example
#
#   GemVersion.parse("0.1.0-pre.1").next(:patch, "pre").to_s  # => "0.1.0-pre.2"
#   GemVersion.parse("0.1.0-pre.2").next(:patch).to_s         # => "0.1.0"
#   GemVersion.parse("1.0.0-beta.1").rubygems                 # => "1.0.0.pre.beta.1"
#   GemVersion.parse("0.1.0.pre.2").cargo                     # => "0.1.0-pre.2"
